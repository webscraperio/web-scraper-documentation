# Remove column parser
Sometimes columns like `web-scraper-order`, `web-scraper-start-url`, columns generated by the [Link selector]
[link-selector] or even columns that were used as a source for [Virtual column][virtual-column] are not needed in the 
output data file. With `Remove column` parser you can clean up the scraped data file from unnecessary columns.

[Virtual column][virtual-column] parser will still contain data if its source column is removed.

Column can be removed or restored by toggling the rightmost button.

By removing the virtual column, the parser will be deleted with all its child parsers and it will not be possible to restore
them.
