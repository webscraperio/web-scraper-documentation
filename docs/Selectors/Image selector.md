# Image selector
Image selector can extract `src` attribute (URL) of an image. 

**Note!** When selecting CSS selector for image selector all the images within the
site are moved to the top. If this feature somehow breaks sites layout please
report it as a bug.

## Configuration options
 * selector - [CSS selector] [css-selector] for the image element.
 * multiple - multiple records are being extracted. Usually should not be
 checked for Image selector.

## Use cases
See [Text selector] [text-selector] use cases.

## Image downloader script

Image downloader script finds image urls scraped by Image Selector in a csv file and downloads them. 
It will try to download images from all URLs that are stored in columns that 
names end with `-src`. `web-scraper-order` and `web-scraper-start-url` columns are 
required in order for script to work. Images are renamed to 
`<web-scraper-order>-<selector-name>.ext`.
